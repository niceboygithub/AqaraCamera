# Aqara Camera G3 integration for Home Assistant

**ATTENTION:** The component **only works after enabled telnet.** Only supportd stream. Not support motion detection, ai etc. yet.

This is a way to [enable telnet](https://github.com/Wh1terat/aQRootG3) from #Wh1terat. Thankes for Wh1terat for the amazing aQRootG3 v0.2.0.

After enabled telnet, you need to finish the configuration before reboot G3.

## WebRTC

You can use [@AlexxIT's WebRTC](https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC) integration. The usage was well documented in AlexxIT's github.
The rtsp url can be found in Attributes of Camera (find it in developer-tools/state).
You need to notice that the url was changed on every reboot of Aqara Camera.
